## Case Study

PokeBinder is a iOS app that helps Pokemon card collectors organize their binders based on set and even possibly create new binders! 

We have a landing page for users to log in, a home page where all of the binders are stored and the card page inside of the binder for users to click on the cards and add them to their database.
