## Case Study

da.ily was created for a final project in our Web Development class where we used basic HTML, CSS & JavaScript to create a website

We wanted to help students study especially at the time we were all busy with exams. It's very cozy, and has multiple themes to suit people's taste! And also multiple tools like a calendar, Pomodoro Timer and even a dashboard for your profile and classes!

I helped design and code the calendar page even though it is not shown in the figma.
